//! In VST terminology, the editor is a graphical window that can be used to display and interact
//! with a plugin using a custom visual appearance.
//!
//! The editor interface runs fully on the UI thread. It manages an OS window through a
//! cross-platform API exposed by the `vst_window` crate. It displays the state of the plugin
//! graphically, instructs the overall plugin state to update in response to window input events,
//! and handles notifications of state updates that occur on the processing thread.
